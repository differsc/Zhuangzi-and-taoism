        <h2>Who was Zhuangzi?</h2>
        <p>Zhuangzi was a Taoist philosopher active during the late Warring States Period, whose
            style of thought <!--improve wording--> was contradictory, absurd, and at times humorous
            pointing out the futility of the search for deeper meaning. This line of thought came
            largely as a reaction to the Confucianist dogma of the time, which promoted rigorous
            traditionalism as the way of the Tao. Zhuangzi thought this to be ridiculous, and set
            out through his writings to teach Taoism in a much more relative way.</p>
        <h2>Corpus:</h2>
        <p><!--translation-->We selected the first nine chapters of The Zhuangzi for markup. These
            passages are known collectively as the 'inner chapters' of The Zhuangzi, because they
            are generally agreed upon by scholars to actually be written by Zhuangzi, and not a
            student or follower. We also included selected passages from
            Confucius,<!--how were these selected?-->.</p>
        <h2>Project:</h2>
        <p><!--RESEARCH QUESTION--> Our initial distinction was marking each passage as either a
            parable or an argument. From there,we marked the linguistic techniques employed by
            Zhuangzi, such as metaphor, simile, and paradoxes, as well as their connotation. This
            allowed us to <!--RESEARCH QUESTION-->.</p>
