        <h2>Who was Zhuangzi?</h2>
        <p>Zhuangzi was a Taoist philosopher active during the late Warring States Period, whose
            approach to Taoism was contradictory, absurd, and at times humorous pointing out the
            futility of the search for deeper meaning. This line of thought came largely as a
            reaction to the Confucianist dogma of the time, which promoted rigorous traditionalism
            as the way of the Tao. Zhuangzi thought this to be ridiculous, and set out through his
            writings to teach Taoism in a much more relative way.</p>
        <h2>Corpus:</h2>
        <p>We selected the first nine chapters of The Zhuangzi for markup, using a translation by
            Oxford linguist James Legge (1815-97) found <a href="https://ctext.org/zhuangzi/zhs"
                >here</a>. These passages are known collectively as the 'inner chapters' of The
            Zhuangzi, because they are generally agreed upon by scholars to actually be written by
            Zhuangzi, and not a student or follower. We also included selected passages from
            Confucius, chosen for their succinct presentation of Confucian ideals.</p>
        <h2>Project:</h2>
        <p>Our goal with our project was to understand and quantify the linguistic techniques used
            by Zhuangzi in relation to the philosophical points he makes in his work, as well as how
            he argues these topics.</p>
