            <h1>Enjoyment In Untroubled Ease</h1>
            <section>

                <p>In the Northern Ocean there is a fish, the name of which is Kun - I do not know
                    how many li in size. It changes into a bird with the name of Peng, the back of
                    which is (also) - I do not know how many li in extent. When this bird rouses
                    itself and flies, its wings are like clouds all round the sky. When the sea is
                    moved (so as to bear it along), it prepares to remove to the Southern Ocean. The
                    Southern Ocean is the Pool of Heaven.</p>

                <p><span class="ref" id="historical">There is the (book called) Qi Xie, a record of
                        marvels. We have in it these words: 'When the peng is removing to the
                        Southern Ocean it flaps (its wings) on the water for 3000 li. Then it
                        ascends on a whirlwind 90,000 li, and it rests only at the end of six
                        months.'</span> (But similar to this is the movement of the breezes which we
                    call) the horses of the fields, of the dust (which quivers in the sunbeams), and
                    of living things as they are blown against one another by the air.<span
                        class="rhetorical">Is its azure the proper colour of the sky?</span> Or is
                    it occasioned by its distance and illimitable extent? If one were looking down
                    (from above), the very same appearance would just meet his view.</p>

                <p> And moreover, (to speak of) the accumulation of water; if it be not great, it
                    will not have strength to support a large boat. Upset a cup of water in a
                    cavity, and a straw will float on it as if it were a boat. Place a cup in it,
                    and it will stick fast; the water is shallow and the boat is large. (So it is
                    with) the accumulation of wind; if it be not great, it will not have strength to
                    support great wings. Therefore (the peng ascended to) the height of 90,000 li,
                    and there was such a mass of wind beneath it; thenceforth the accumulation of
                    wind was sufficient. As it seemed to bear the blue sky on its back, and there
                    was nothing to obstruct or arrest its course, it could pursue its way to the
                    South.</p>

                <p>A cicada and a little dove laughed at it, saying, <span class="speech"
                        title="Cicada and Dove">'We make an effort and fly towards an elm or
                        sapanwood tree; and sometimes before we reach it, we can do no more but drop
                        to the ground. Of what use is it for this (creature) to rise 90,000 li, and
                        make for the South?'</span> He who goes to the grassy suburbs, returning to
                    the third meal (of the day), will have his belly as full as when he set out; he
                    who goes to a distance of 100 li will have to pound his grain where he stops for
                    the night; he who goes a thousand li, will have to carry with him provisions for
                    three months. What should these two small creatures know about the matter? <span
                        class="comparison">The knowledge of that which is small does not reach to
                        that which is great; (the experience of) a few years does not reach to that
                        of many.</span>
                    <span class="rhetorical">How do we know that it is so?</span> The mushroom of a
                    morning does not know (what takes place between) the beginning and end of a
                    month; the short-lived cicada does not know (what takes place between) the
                    spring and autumn. These are instances of a short term of life. In the south of
                        <span class="ref" id="geographic">Chu</span> there is the (tree) called
                    Ming-ling, whose spring is 500 years, and its autumn the same; in high antiquity
                    there was that called Da-chun, whose spring was 8000 years, and its autumn the
                    same. And Peng Zu is the one man renowned to the present day for his length of
                    life: <span class="rhetorical">if all men were (to wish) to match him, would
                        they not be miserable?</span></p>

                <p>In the questions put by Tang to Ji we have similar statements:<span
                        class="speech" title="Tang">'In the bare and barren north there is the dark
                        and vast ocean - the Pool of Heaven. In it there is a fish, several thousand
                        li in breadth, while no one knows its length. Its name is the kun. There is
                        (also) a bird named the peng; its back is like the Tai mountain, while its
                        wings are like clouds all round the sky. <span class="figurative"
                            style="simile">On a whirlwind it mounts upwards as on the whorls of a
                            goat's horn</span> for 90,000 li, till, far removed from the cloudy
                        vapours, <span class="figurative" style="symbolism">it bears on its back the
                            blue sky</span>, and then it shapes its course for the South, and
                        proceeds to the ocean there.' A quail by the side of a marsh laughed at it,
                        and said, 'Where is it going to? I spring up with a bound, and come down
                        again when I have reached but a few fathoms, and then fly about among the
                        brushwood and bushes; and this is the perfection of flying. Where is that
                        creature going to?</span>' This shows the difference between the small and
                    the great.</p>
            </section>
            <section>

                <p>Thus it is that men, whose wisdom is sufficient for the duties of some one
                    office, or whose conduct will secure harmony in some one district, or whose
                    virtue is befitting a ruler so that they could efficiently govern some one
                    state, are sure to look on themselves in this manner (like the quail), and yet
                    Rongzi of Song would have smiled and laughed at them. (This Rongzi), <span
                        class="figurative" style="hyperbole">though the whole world should have
                        praised him</span>, would not for that have stimulated himself to greater
                    endeavour, and <span class="figurative" style="hyperbole">though the whole world
                        should have condemned him</span>, would not have exercised any more
                    repression of his course; so fixed was he in the difference between the internal
                    (judgment of himself) and the external (judgment of others), so distinctly had
                    he marked out the bounding limit of glory and disgrace. Here, however, he
                    stopped. <span class="figurative" style="personification">His place in the world
                        indeed had become indifferent to him</span>, but still he had not planted
                    himself firmly (in the right position). There was Liezi, who rode on the wind
                    and pursued his way, with an admirable indifference (to all external things),
                    returning, however, after fifteen days, (to his place). In regard to the things
                    that (are supposed to) contribute to happiness, he was free from all endeavours
                    to obtain them; but though he had not to walk, there was still something for
                    which he had to wait. But suppose one who mounts on (the ether of) heaven and
                    earth in its normal operation, and drives along the six elemental energies of
                    the changing (seasons), thus enjoying himself in the illimitable - what has he
                    to wait for? Therefore it is said, 'The Perfect man has no (thought of) self;
                    the Spirit-like man, none of merit; the Sagely-minded man, none of fame.' </p>

                <p> Yao, proposing to resign the throne to Xu You, said, <span class="speech"

                        the reality; shall I be playing the part of the guest? The tailor-bird makes
                        its nest in the deep forest, but only uses a single branch; the mole drinks

                <p>Huizi told Zhuangzi, saying,<span class="speech" title="Huizi">'The king of Wei
                        sent me some seeds of a large calabash, which I sowed. The fruit, when fully
                        grown, could contain five piculs (of anything). I used it to contain water,
                        but it was so heavy that I could not lift it by myself. I cut it in two to
                        make the parts into drinking vessels; but the dried shells were too wide and
                        unstable and would not hold (the liquor); nothing but large useless things!
                        Because of their uselessness I knocked them to pieces.'</span> Zhuangzi
                    replied, <span class="speech" title="Zhuangzi">'You were indeed stupid, my
                        master, in the use of what was large. There was a man of Song who was
                        skilful at making a salve which kept the hands from getting chapped; and
                        (his family) for generations had made the bleaching of cocoon-silk their
                        business. A stranger heard of it, and proposed to buy the art of the
                        preparation for a hundred ounces of silver. The kindred all came together,
                        and considered the proposal. "We have," said they, "been bleaching
                        cocoon-silk for generations, and have only gained a little money. Now in one
                        morning we can sell to this man our art for a hundred ounces - let him have
                        it." The stranger accordingly got it and went away with it to give counsel
                        to the king of Wu, who was then engaged in hostilities with Yue. The king
                        gave him the command of his fleet, and in the winter he had an engagement
                        with that of Yue, on which he inflicted a great defeat, and was invested
                        with a portion of territory taken from Yue. The keeping the hands from
                        getting chapped was the same in both cases; but in the one case it led to
                        the investiture (of the possessor of the salve), and in the other it had
                        only enabled its owners to continue their bleaching. The difference of
                        result was owing to the different use made of the art. Now you, Sir, had
                        calabashes large enough to hold five piculs; why did you not think of making
                        large bottle-gourds of them, by means of which you could have floated over
                        rivers and lakes, instead of giving yourself the sorrow of finding that they
                        were useless for holding anything. Your mind, my master, would seem to have
                        been closed against all intelligence!'</span></p>

                        about, avoiding neither what is high nor what is low, till it is caught in a
                        trap, or dies in a net. Again there is the Yak, <span class="figurative"
                            style="simile">so large that it is like a cloud hanging in the
                            sky</span>. It is large indeed, but it cannot catch mice. You, Sir, have
                        a large tree and are troubled because it is of no use - why do you not plant
                        it in a tract where there is nothing else, or in a wide and barren wild?
                        There you might saunter idly by its side, or in the enjoyment of untroubled
                        ease sleep beneath it. Neither bill nor axe would shorten its existence;
                        there would be nothing to injure it. <span class="rhetorical">What is there
                            in its uselessness to cause you distress?</span></span>'</p>
