        <p> Our initial distinction was marking each passage wihin a chapter as either a parable or
            an argument. From there,we marked the linguistic techniques employed by Zhuangzi, such
            as metaphor, simile, and paradoxes, as well as their connotation, either positive or
            negative. After we marked up the linguistic features, we added speaker names and
            references to geographic locations, external quotes, and historical events. The Zhuangzi
            is already very linguistically dense, so adding extra clarity and continuity to even
            these parts of the text has the potential to greatly increase the reader's comprehension
            of the text.</p>
