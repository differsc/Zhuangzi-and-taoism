            <p> Our initial distinction was marking each passage wihin a chapter as either a parable
                or an argument. From there,we marked the linguistic techniques employed by Zhuangzi,
                such as metaphor, simile, and paradoxes, as well as their connotation, either
                positive or negative. After we marked up the linguistic features, we added speaker
                names and references to geographic locations, external quotes, and historical
                events. The Zhuangzi is already very linguistically dense, so adding extra clarity
                and continuity to even these parts of the text has the potential to greatly increase
                the reader's comprehension of the text.</p>

            <h2>Paradox</h2>
            <p>"a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition that when

            <h2>Comparision</h2>
            <p>Zhuangzi comparing opposite things; not exactly "absurd" like a paradox would be,
                moreso implying unity in absolute opposite polarity.</p>
            <h2>Positive/Negative</h2>
            <p>Sometimes comparison doesn't come hand in hand, so we tag it differently

                answer)</p>
