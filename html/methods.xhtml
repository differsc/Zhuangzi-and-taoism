        <p> Our initial distinction was marking each passage wihin a chapter as either a parable or
            an argument. From there,we marked the linguistic techniques employed by Zhuangzi, such
            as metaphor, simile, and paradoxes, as well as their connotation, either positive or
            negative.</p>
