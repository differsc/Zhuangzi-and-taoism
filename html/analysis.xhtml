        <p> In our results, we found that percentage of figurative lanugage per chapter ranged
            between around 3 and 12 percent, with higher percentages found in chapters that featured
            more parables and less arguments. Across the board, simile and metaphor comprised vast
            majority of figurative language Zhuangzi used. This is consistent with the style in
            which he constructs his arguments, wherein things that may not at all be like one
            another are implied to be identical, effectively neutralizing the meaning brought on
            through the comparison of the two. The only chapter with significant topical focus is
            the Nourishing of the Lord of Life. Admittedly, this could be a human error on our part,
            as the underlying themes of the Zhuangzi are not always easily identifiable through the
            structure and literal meaning of itself (especially given our limited experience and
            time allowed to sit with the translation) and have been discussed for millenia. </p>
