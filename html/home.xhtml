            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Zhuangzi was born in the 4th century BCE in the state of Song. He is known for his
                contributions to Taoism and his philosophy on the nature of reality and the self.
                His work is often compared to that of Lao Tzu, the author of the Tao Te Ching.</p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_Hui" target="_blank" class="hover-effect"
                    >Yan Hui</a> said, 'I can go no farther; I venture to ask the method from you.'
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius" target="_blank">Zhongni</a>
                replied, 'It is <span class="emphasis">fasting</span>, (as) I will tell you. (But)
                when you have the method, will you find it easy to practise it? He who thinks it
                easy will be disapproved of by the bright Heaven.' Hui said, 'My family is poor. For
                months together we have no spirituous drink, nor do we taste the proscribed food or
                any strong-smelling vegetables;-- can this be regarded as fasting?' The reply was,
                'It is the fasting appropriate to sacrificing, but it is not the fasting of the
                mind.' 'I venture to ask what that <span class="emphasis">fasting of the mind</span>
                is,' said Hui, and Zhongni answered, 'Maintain a perfect unity in every movement of
                your will, You will not wait for the hearing of your ears about it, but for the
                hearing of your mind. You will not wait even for the hearing of your mind, but for
                the hearing of the spirit. Let the hearing (of the ears) rest with the ears. Let the
                mind rest in the verification (of the rightness of what is in the will). But the
                spirit is free from all pre-occupation and so waits for (the appearance of) things.
                Where the (proper) course is, there is freedom from all pre-occupation; such freedom
                is the fasting of the mind.' Hui said, 'Before it was possible for me to employ
                (this method), there I was, the Hui that I am; now, that I can employ it, the Hui
                that I was has passed away. Can I be said to have obtained this freedom from
                pre-occupation?' </p>
            <p>The Master replied, 'Entirely. I tell you that you can enter and be at ease in the
                enclosure (where he is), and not come into collision with the reputation (which
                belongs to him). If he listen to your counsels, let him hear your notes; if he will
                not listen, be silent. Open no (other) door; employ no other medicine; dwell with
                him (as with a friend) in the same apartment, and as if you had no other option, and
                you will not be far from success in your object. Not to move a step is easy; to walk
                without treading on the ground is difficult. In acting after the manner of men, it
                is easy to fall into hypocrisy; in acting after the manner of Heaven, it is
                difficult to play the hypocrite. I have heard of flying with wings; I have not heard
                of flying without them. I have heard of the knowledge of the wise; I have not heard
                of the knowledge of the unwise. Look at that aperture (left in the wall); the empty
                apartment is filled with light through it. Felicitous influences rest (in the mind
                thus emblemed), as in their proper resting place. Even when they do not so rest, we
                have what is called (the body) seated and (the mind) galloping abroad. The
                information that comes through the ears and eyes is comprehended internally, and the
                knowledge of the mind becomes something external: (when this is the case), the
                spiritual intelligences will come, and take up their dwelling with us, and how much
                more will other men do so! All things thus undergo a transforming influence. This
                was the hinge on which Yu and Shun moved; it was this which Fu-xi and Ji-qu
                practised all their lives: how much more should other men follow the same rule!'</p>
