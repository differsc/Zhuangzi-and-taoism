        <p>Nan-Guo Zi-Qi was seated, leaning forward on his stool. He was looking up to heaven and
            breathed gently, seeming to be in a trance, and to have lost all consciousness of any
            companion. (His disciple), Yan Cheng Zi-You, who was in attendance and standing before
            him, said, <speech speaker="Yan Cheng Zi-You">'What is this? <rhetorical
                    topic="body and soul">Can the body be made to become thus like a withered tree,
                    and the mind to become like slaked lime?</rhetorical>His appearance as he leans
                forward on the stool to-day is such as I never saw him have before in the same
                position.'</speech> Zi-Qi said, <speech speaker="Nan-Guo Zi-Qi">'Yan, you do well to
                ask such a question, I had just now lost myself; but how should you understand
                it?You may have heard the notes of Man, but have not heard those of Earth; you may
                have heard the notes of Earth, but have not heard those of Heaven.'</speech></p>
        <p>Zi-You said, <speech speaker="Yan Cheng Zi-You">'I venture to ask from you a description
                of all these.'</speech> The reply was, <speech speaker="Nan-Guo Zi-Qi">'When the
                breath of the Great Mass (of nature) comes strongly, it is called Wind. Sometimes it
                does not come so; but when it does, then from a myriad apertures there issues its
                excited noise; have you not heard it in a prolonged gale? Take the projecting bluff
                of a mountain forest - in the great trees, a hundred spans round, <figurative>the
                    apertures and cavities are like the nostrils, or the mouth, or the ears; now
                    square, now round like a cup or a mortar; here like a wet footprint, and there
                    like a large puddle. (The sounds issuing from them are like) those of fretted
                    water, of the arrowy whizz,of the stern command, of the inhaling of the breath,
                    of the shout, of the gruff note, of the deep wail, of the sad and piping
                    note.</figurative> The first notes are slight, and those that follow deeper, but
                in harmony with them. <figurative>Gentle winds produce a small response; violent
                    winds a great one. When the fierce gusts have passed away, all the apertures are
                    empty (and still)</figurative> have you not seen this in the bending and
                quivering of the branches and leaves?'</speech></p>
        <p>Zi-You said, <speech speaker="Yan Cheng Zi-You">'The notes of Earth then are simply those
                which come from its myriad apertures; and the notes of Man may just be compared to
                those which (are brought from the tubes of) bamboo- allow me to ask about the notes
                of Heaven.'</speech> Zi-Qi replied, <speech speaker="Nan-Guo Zi-Qi">'Blowing the
                myriad differences, making them stop [proceed] of themselves, sealing their
                self-selecting - who is it that stirs it all up?'</speech></p>

            bound with cords, showing that the mind is become like an old and dry moat, and that it
            is nigh to death, and cannot be restored to vigour and brightness. ThenJoy and anger,

            conflict with things or in harmony with them, they pursue their course to the end, with
            the speed of a galloping horse which cannot be stopped - is it not sad? To be constantly
            toiling all one's lifetime, without seeing the fruit of one's labour, and to be weary
            and worn out with his labour, without knowing where he is going to - is it not a
            deplorable case? Men may say, 'But it is not death;' yet of what advantage is this? When
            the body is decomposed, the mind will be the same along with it - must not the case be
            pronounced very deplorable? Is the life of man indeed enveloped in such darkness? Is it
            I alone to whom it appears so? And does it not appear to be so to other men? </p>

        <p>If we were to follow the judgments of the predetermined mind, who would be left alone and
            without a teacher? Not only would it be so with those who know the sequences (of
            knowledge and feeling) and make their own selection among them, but it would be so as
            well with the stupid and unthinking. For one who has not this determined mind, to have
            his affirmations and negations is like the case described in the saying, 'He went to Yue
            to-day, and arrived at it yesterday.' It would be making what was not a fact to be a
            fact. But even the spirit-like Yu could not have known how to do this, and how should
            one like me be able to do it? But speech is not like the blowing (of the wind); the
            speech has (a meaning in) his words.If, however, what he says, be indeterminate (as from
            a mind not made up), does he then really speak or not? He thinks that his words are
            different from the chirpings of fledgelings; but is there any distinction between them
            or not? But how can the Dao be so obscured, that there should be 'a True' and 'a False'
            in it? How can speech be so obscured that there should be 'the Right' and 'the Wrong'
            about them? Where shall the Dao go to that it will not be found? Where shall speech be
            found that it will be inappropriate? Dao becomes obscured through the small
            comprehension (of the mind), and speech comes to be obscure through the
            vain-gloriousness (of the speech). So it is that we have the contentions between the
            Literati and the Mohists, the one side affirming what the other denies, and vice versa.
            If we would decide on their several affirmations and denials, no plan is like bringing
            the (proper) light (of the mind) to bear on them.</p>

        <p>There is no thing that is not "that", and there is no thing that is not "this". If I look
            at something from "that", I do not see it; only if I look at it from knowing do I know
            it. Hence it is said, 'That view comes from this; and this view is a consequence of
            that:' - which is the theory that that view and this (the opposite views) produce each
            the other. Although it be so, there is affirmed now life and now death; now death and
            now life; now the admissibility of a thing and now its inadmissibility; now its
            inadmissibility and now its admissibility.</p>
        <p><rhetorical topic="right and wrong">(The disputants) now affirm and now deny; now deny
                and now affirm. Therefore the sagely man does not pursue this method, but views
                things in the light of (his) Heaven (-ly nature), and hence forms his judgment of
                what is right. This view is the same as that, and that view is the same as this. But
                that view involves both a right and a wrong; and this view involves also a right and
                a wrong</rhetorical> - are there indeed the two views, that and this? Or are there
            not the two views, that and this? They have not found their point of correspondency
            which is called the pivot of the Dao. As soon as one finds this pivot, he stands in the
            centre of the ring (of thought), where he can respond without end to the changing views;
            without end to those affirming, and without end to those denying. Therefore I said,
            'There is nothing like the proper light (of the mind).'</p>

        <p>By means of a finger (of my own) to illustrate that the finger (of another) is not a
            finger is not so good a plan as to illustrate that it is not so by means of what is
            (acknowledged to be) not a finger; and by means of (what I call) a horse to illustrate
            that (what another calls) a horse is not so, is not so good a plan as to illustrate that
            it is not a horse, by means of what is (acknowledged to be) not a horse. (All things in)
            heaven and earth may be (dealt with as) a finger; (each of) their myriads may be (dealt

            to me? (I say that) it is not so. A path is formed by (constant) treading on the ground.
            A thing is called by its speaker through the (constant) application of the speaker to
            it. How is it so? It is so because it is so. How is it not so? It is not so, because it
            is not so.</p>
        <p> Everything has its inherent character and its proper capability. There is nothing which
            has not these. Therefore, this being so,if we take a stalk of grain and a (large)
            pillar, a loathsome (leper) and (a beauty like) Xi Shi, things large and things
            insecure, things crafty and things strange; they may in the light of the Dao all be
            reduced to the same category (of opinion about them). It was separation that led to
            completion; from completion ensued dissolution. But all things, without regard to their
            completion and dissolution, may again be comprehended in their unity - it is only the
            far reaching in thought who know how to comprehend them in this unity. This being so,
            let us give up our devotion to our own views, and occupy ourselves with the ordinary
            views. These ordinary views are grounded on the use of things. (The study of that) use
            leads to the comprehensive judgment, and that judgment secures the success (of the
            inquiry). That success gained, we are near (to the object of our search), and there we
            stop. When we stop, and yet we do not know how it is so, we have what is called the
            Dao.</p>
        <p> When we toil our spirits and intelligence, obstinately determined (to establish our own
            view), and do not know the agreement (which underlies it and the views of others), we
            have what is called 'In the morning three.' What is meant by that 'In the morning
            three?' A keeper of monkeys, in giving them out their acorns, (once) said, 'In the
            morning I will give you three (measures) and in the evening four.' This made them all
            angry, and he said, 'Very well. In the morning I will give you four and in the evening
            three.' The monkeys were all pleased. His two proposals were substantially the same, but
            the result of the one was to make the creatures angry, and of the other to make them
            pleased - an illustration of the point I am insisting on. Therefore the sagely man
            brings together a dispute in its affirmations and denials, and rests in the equal
            fashioning of Heaven. Both sides of the question are admissible.</p>

        <p>Among the men of old their knowledge reached the extreme point.What was that extreme
            point? Some held that at first there was not anything. This is the extreme point, the
            utmost point to which nothing can be added. A second class held that there was
            something, but without any responsive recognition of it (on the part of men). A third
            class held that there was such recognition, but there had not begun to be any expression
            of different opinions about it. It was through the definite expression of different
            opinions about it that there ensued injury to (the doctrine of) the Dao. It was this
            injury to the (doctrine of the) Dao which led to the formation of (partial)
            preferences.Was it indeed after such preferences were formed that the injury came? or
            did the injury precede the rise of such preferences?If the injury arose after their
            formation, Zhao's method of playing on the lute was natural. If the injury arose before
            their formation, there would have been no such playing on the lute as Zhao's. Zhao Wen's
            playing on the lute, Shi Kuang's indicating time with his staff, and Huizi's (giving his
            views),</p>
        <p>while leaning against a dryandra tree (were all extraordinary). The knowledge of the
            three men (in their several arts) was nearly perfect, and therefore they practised them
            to the end of their lives. They loved them because they were different from those of
            others.They loved them and wished to make them known to others. But as they could not be
            made clear, though they tried to make them so, they ended with the obscure (discussions)
            about 'the hard' and 'the white.' And their sons, moreover, with all the threads of
            their fathers' compositions, yet to the end of their lives accomplished nothing. If
            they, proceeding in this way, could be said to have succeeded, then am I also
            successful; if they cannot be pronounced successful, neither I nor any other can
            succeed. <rhetorical topic="the true one">Therefore the scintillations of light from the
                midst of confusion and perplexity are indeed valued by the sagely man; but not to
                use one's own views and to take his position on the ordinary views is what is called
                using the (proper) light.</rhetorical></p>

        <p>The Dao at first met with no responsive recognition. Speech at first had no constant
            forms of expression. Because of this there came the demarcations (of different
            views).Let me describe those demarcations: they are the Left and the Right; the
            Relations and their Obligations; Classifications and their Distinctions; Emulations and
            Contentions. These are what are called 'the Eight Qualities.' Outside the limits of the
            world of men, the sage occupies his thoughts, but does not discuss about anything;
            inside those limits he occupies his thoughts, but does not pass any judgments. In the
            Chun Qiu, which embraces the history of the former kings, the sage indicates his
            judgments, but does not argue (in vindication of them). Thus it is that he separates his
            characters from one another without appearing to do so, and argues without the form of
            section. How does he do so? The sage cherishes his views in his own breast, while men
            generally state theirs sectionatively, to show them to others. Hence we have the saying,
            'Disputation is a proof of not seeing clearly.'The Great Dao does not admit of being
            praised. The Great section does not require words. Great Benevolence is not
            (officiously) benevolent. Great Disinterestedness does not vaunt its humility. Great
            Courage is not seen in stubborn bravery. The Dao that is displayed is not the Dao. Words
            that are sectionative do not reach the point. Benevolence that is constantly exercised
            does not accomplish its object. Disinterestedness that vaunts its purity is not genuine.
            Courage that is most stubborn is ineffectual. These five seem to be round (and
            complete), but they tend to become square (and immovable).</p>
        <p><rhetorical topic="knowledge">Therefore the knowledge that stops at what it does not know
                is the greatest.</rhetorical> Who knows the section that needs no words, and the Way
            that is not to be trodden? He who is able to know this has what is called 'The Heavenly
            Treasure-house.' He may pour into it without its being filled; he may pour from it
            without its being exhausted; and all the while he does not know whence (the supply)
            comes. This is what is called 'The Store of Light.'Therefore of old Yao asked Shun,
            saying, 'I wish to smite (the rulers of) Zong, Kuai, and Xu-Ao. Even when standing in my
            court, I cannot get them out of my mind. How is it so?' Shun replied, 'Those three
            rulers live (in their little states) as if they were among the mugwort and other
            brushwood - how is it that you cannot get them out of your mind? Formerly, ten suns came

                speaker="Nie Que">'Do you know what it is that you do not know?'</speech> asked the
            other again, and <speech speaker="Wang Ni">he got the same reply.</speech> He asked a
            third time, <speech speaker="Nie Que">'Then are all creatures thus without
                knowledge?'</speech> and <speech speaker="Wang Ni">Wang Ni answered as
                before</speech>, (adding however), <speech speaker="Wang Ni">'Notwithstanding, I
                will try and explain my meaning. How do you know that when I say "I know it," I
                really (am showing that) I do not know it, and that when I say "I do not know it," I
                really am showing that I do know it.' And let me ask you some questions: 'If a man
                sleep in a damp place, he will have a pain in his loins, and half his body will be
                as if it were dead; but will it be so with an eel? If he be living in a tree, he
                will be frightened and all in a tremble; but will it be so with a monkey? And does
                any one of the three know his right place ? Men eat animals that have been fed on
                grain and grass; deer feed on the thick-set grass; centipedes enjoy small snakes;
                owls and crows delight in mice; but does any one of the four know the right taste?
                The dog-headed monkey finds its mate in the female gibbon; the elk and the axis deer
                cohabit; and the eel enjoys itself with other fishes. Mao Qiang and Li Ji were
                accounted by men to be most beautiful, but when fishes saw them, they dived deep in
                the water from them; when birds, they flew from them aloft; and when deer saw them,
                they separated and fled away. But did any of these four know which in the world is
                the right female attraction? As I look at the matter, the first principles of
                benevolence and righteousness and the paths of approval and disapproval are
                inextricably mixed and confused together - how is it possible that I should know how
                to discriminate among them?'</speech></p>
        <p>Nie Que said (further),<speech speaker="Nie Que"> 'Since you, Sir, do not know what is
                advantageous and what is hurtful, is the Perfect man also in the same way without
                the knowledge of them?'</speech> Wang Ni replied, <speech speaker="Wang Ni">'The
                Perfect man is spirit-like. Great lakes might be boiling about him, and he would not
                feel their heat; the He and the Han might be frozen up, and he would not feel the
                cold; the hurrying thunderbolts might split the mountains, and the wind shake the
                ocean, without being able to make him afraid. Being such, he mounts on the clouds of
                the air, rides on the sun and moon, and rambles at ease beyond the four seas.
                Neither death nor life makes any change in him, and how much less should the
                considerations of advantage and injury do so!'</speech></p>

        <p>Qu Quezi asked Chang Wuzi, saying, <speech speaker="Qu Quezi">'I heard the Master
                (speaking of such language as the following): "The sagely man does not occupy
                himself with worldly affairs. He does not put himself in the way of what is
                profitable, nor try to avoid what is hurtful; he has no pleasure in seeking (for
                anything from any one); he does not care to be found in (any established) Way; he
                speaks without speaking; he does not speak when he speaks; thus finding his
                enjoyment outside the dust and dirt (of the world)." The Master considered all this
                to be a shoreless flow of mere words, and I consider it to describe the course of
                the Mysterious Way - What do you, Sir, think of it?'</speech></p>
        <p>Chang Wuzi replied, <speech speaker="Chang Wuzi">'The hearing of such words would have
                perplexed even Huang Di, and how should Qiu be competent to understand them? And
                you, moreover, are too hasty in forming your estimate (of their meaning). You see
                the egg, and (immediately) look out for the cock (that is to be hatched from it);
                you see the bow, and (immediately) look out for the dove (that is to be brought down
                by it) being roasted. I will try to explain the thing to you in a rough way; do you
                in the same way listen to me. How could any one stand by the side of the sun and
                moon, and hold under his arm all space and all time? (Such language only means that
                the sagely man) keeps his mouth shut, and puts aside questions that are uncertain
                and dark; making his inferior capacities unite with him in honouring (the One
                Lord).Men in general bustle about and toil; the sagely man seems stupid and to know
                nothing. He blends ten thousand years together in the one (conception of time); the
                myriad things all pursue their spontaneous course, and they are all before him as
                doing so. How do I know that the love of life is not a delusion? and that the
                dislike of death is not like a young person's losing his way, and not knowing that
                he is (really) going home? Li Ji was a daughter of the border Warden of Ai. When
                (the ruler of) the state of Jin first got possession of her, she wept till the tears
                wetted all the front of her dress. But when she came to the place of the king,
                shared with him his luxurious couch, and ate his grain-and-grass-fed meat, then she
                regretted that she had wept. How do I know that the dead do not repent of their
                former craving for life? Those who dream of (the pleasures of) drinking may in the
                morning wail and weep; those who dream of wailing and weeping may in the morning be
                going out to hunt. When they were dreaming they did not know it was a dream; in
                their dream they may even have tried to interpret it; but when they awoke they knew
                that it was a dream. And there is the great awaking, after which we shall know that
                this life was a great dream. All the while, the stupid think they are awake, and
                with nice discrimination insist on their knowledge; now playing the part of rulers,
                and now of grooms. Bigoted was that Qiu! He and you are both dreaming. I who say
                that you are dreaming am dreaming myself. These words seem very strange; but if
                after ten thousand ages we once meet with a great sage who knows how to explain
                them, it will be as if we met him (unexpectedly) some morning or evening. Since you
                made me enter into this discussion with you, if you have got the better of me and
                not I of you, are you indeed right, and I indeed wrong?If I have got the better of
                you and not you of me, am I indeed right and you indeed wrong? Is the one of us
                right and the other wrong? are we both right or both wrong? Since we cannot come to
                a mutual and common understanding, men will certainly continue in darkness on the
                subject. Whom shall I employ to adjudicate in the matter? If I employ one who agrees
                with you, how can he, agreeing with you, do so correctly? If I employ one who agrees
                with me, how can he, agreeing with me, do so correctly? If I employ one who
                disagrees with you and I, how can he, disagreeing with you and I, do so correctly?
                If I employ one who agrees with you and I, how can he, agreeing with you and I, do
                so correctly? In this way I and you and those others would all not be able to come
                to a mutual understanding; and shall we then wait for that (great sage)? (We need
                not do so.) To wait on others to learn how conflicting opinions are changed is
                simply like not so waiting at all. The harmonising of them is to be found in the
                invisible operation of Heaven, and by following this on into the unlimited past. It
                is by this method that we can complete our years (without our minds being
                disturbed). What is meant by harmonising (conflicting opinions) in the invisible
                operation of Heaven? There is the affirmation and the denial of it; and there is the
                assertion of an opinion and the rejection of it. If the affirmation be according to
                the reality of the fact, it is certainly different from the denial of it - there can
                be no dispute about that. If the assertion of an opinion be correct, it is certainly
                different from its rejection - neither can there be any dispute about that. Let us
                forget the lapse of time; let us forget the conflict of opinions. Let us make our
                appeal to the Infinite, and take up our position there.'</speech></p>

        <p>The Penumbra asked the Shadow, saying, <speech speaker="Penumbra">'Formerly you were

        <p>Formerly, I, Zhuang Zhou, dreamt that I was a butterfly, a butterfly flying about,
            feeling that it was enjoying itself. I did not know that it was Zhou. Suddenly I awoke,
            and was myself again, the veritable Zhou. I did not know whether it had formerly been
            Zhou dreaming that he was a butterfly, or it was now a butterfly dreaming that it was
            Zhou. But between Zhou and a butterfly there must be a difference. This is a case of
