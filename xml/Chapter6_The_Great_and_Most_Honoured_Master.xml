        <p><paradox>He who knows the part which the Heavenly (in him) plays, and knows (also) that which the
            Human (in him ought to) play, has reached the perfection (of knowledge). He who knows
            the part which the Heavenly plays (knows) that it is naturally born with him; he who
            knows the part which the Human ought to play (proceeds) with the knowledge which he
            possesses to nourish it in the direction of what he does not (yet) know: to complete
            one's natural term of years and not come to an untimely end in the middle of his course
            is the fulness of knowledge. Although it be so, there is an evil (attending this
            condition). Such knowledge still awaits the confirmation of it as correct; it does so
            because it is not yet determined. </paradox><rhetorical>How do we know that what we call the
                Heavenly (in us) is not the Human?</rhetorical>
            <rhetorical>and that what we call the Human is not the Heavenly?</rhetorical> There must
            be the True man, and then there is the True knowledge. </p>
        <p><rhetorical>What is meant by <ref kind="indirect-quote">'the True Man?'</ref></rhetorical> <paradox>The True men of old did not
            reject (the views of) the few; they did not seek to accomplish (their ends) like heroes
            (before others); they did not lay plans to attain those ends. Being such, though they
            might make mistakes, they had no occasion for repentance; though they might succeed,
            they had no self-complacency. Being such, they could ascend the loftiest heights without
            fear; they could pass through water without being made wet by it; they could go into
            fire without being burnt;</paradox> so it was that by their knowledge they ascended to and reached
            the Dao. </p>
        <p><paradox>The True men of old did not dream when they slept, had no anxiety when they awoke, and
            did not care that their food should be pleasant. Their breathing came deep and silently.
            The breathing of the true man comes (even) from his heels, while men generally breathe
            (only) from their throats. When men are defeated in argument, their words come from
            their gullets as if they were vomiting. Where lusts and desires are deep, the springs of
            the Heavenly are shallow.</paradox> </p>
        <p>The True men of old knew nothing of the love of life or of the hatred of death. Entrance
            into life occasioned them no joy; the exit from it awakened no resistance. Composedly
            they went and came. They did not forget what their beginning bad been, and they did not
            inquire into what their end would be. They accepted (their life) and rejoiced in it;
            they forgot (all fear of death), and returned (to their state before life). Thus there
            was in them what is called the want of any mind to resist the Dao, and of all attempts
            by means of the Human to assist the Heavenly. Such were they who are called the True
            men. Being such, their minds were free from all thought; their demeanour was still and
            unmoved; <figurative>their foreheads beamed simplicity.</figurative> <figurative>Whatever coldness came from them was like
            that of autumn; whatever warmth came from them was like that of spring. Their joy and
            anger assimilated to what we see in the four seasons.</figurative> They did in regard to all things
            what was suitable, and no one could know how far their action would go. Therefore the
            sagely man might, in his conduct of war, <paradox>destroy a state without losing the hearts of
            the people;</paradox> <paradox>his benefits and favours might extend to a myriad generations without his
            being a lover of men.</paradox> Hence he who tries to share his joys with others is not a sagely
            man; he who manifests affection is not benevolent; he who observes times and seasons (to
            regulate his conduct) is not a man of wisdom; he to whom profit and injury are not the
            same is not a superior man; he who acts for the sake of the name of doing so, and loses
            his (proper) self is not the (right) scholar; and he who throws away his person in a way
            which is not the true (way) cannot command the service of others. <ref kind="historical">Such men as Hu Bu-jie,
            Wu Guang, Bo-yi, Shu-Qi, the count of Ji, Xu-yu, Ji Ta, and Shen-tu Di</ref>, all did service
            for other men, and sought to secure for them what they desired, not seeking their own
            pleasure. </p>
        <p><paradox><positive>The True men of old presented the aspect of judging others aright, but without being
            partisans; of feeling their own insufficiency, but being without flattery or cringing.
            Their peculiarities were natural to them, but they were not obstinately attached to
            them; their humility was evident, but there was nothing of unreality or display about
            it. Their placidity and satisfaction had the appearance of joy; their every movement
            seemed to be a necessity to them. Their accumulated attractiveness drew men's looks to
            them; their blandness fixed men's attachment to their virtue. They seemed to accommodate
            themselves to the (manners of their age), but with a certain severity; their haughty
            indifference was beyond its control. Unceasing seemed their endeavours to keep (their
            mouths) shut; when they looked down, they had forgotten what they wished to say. They
            considered punishments to be the substance (of government, and they never incurred it);
            ceremonies to be its supporting wings (and they always observed them); wisdom (to
            indicate) the time (for action, and they always selected it); and virtue to be
            accordance (with others), and they were all-accordant. Considering punishments to be the
            substance (of government), yet their generosity appeared in the (manner of their)
            infliction of death. Considering ceremonies to be its supporting wings, they pursued by
            means of them their course in the world. Considering wisdom to indicate the time (for
            action), they felt it necessary to employ it in (the direction of) affairs. Considering
            virtue to be accordance (with others), they sought to ascend its height along with all
            who had feet (to climb it). (Such were they), and yet men really thought that they did
            what they did by earnest effort. In this way they were one and the same in all their
            likings and dislikings. Where they liked, they were the same; where they did not like,
            they were the same. In the former case where they liked, they were fellow-workers with
            the Heavenly (in them); in the latter where they disliked, they were co-workers with the
            Human in them. The one of these elements (in their nature) did not overcome the other.
            Such were those who are called the True men.</positive></paradox></p>

    <section n="2" type="argument">
        <p>Death and life are ordained, just as we have the constant succession of night and day -
            in both cases from Heaven. Men have no power to do anything in reference to them - such
            is the constitution of things. There are those who specially regard Heaven as their
            father, and they still love It (distant as It is); how much more should they love That
            which stands out (Superior and Alone)! Some specially regard their ruler as superior to
            themselves, and will give their bodies to die for him; how much more should they do so
            for That which is their true (Ruler)! When the springs are dried up, the fishes collect
            together on the land. Than that they should moisten one another there by the damp about
            them, and keep one another wet by their slime, it would be better for them to forget one
            another in the rivers and lakes. And <ref kind="historical">when men praise Yao and condemn Jie</ref>, it would be
            better to forget them both, and seek the renovation of the Dao.</p>
        <p>There is the great Mass (of nature) - I find the support of my body on it; my life is
            spent in toil on it; my old age seeks ease on it; at death I find rest in it - what
            makes my life a good makes my death also a good. If you hide away a boat in the ravine
            of a hill, and hide away the hill in a lake, you will say that (the boat) is secure; but
            at midnight there shall come a strong man and carry it off on his back, while you in the
            dark know nothing about it. You may hide away anything, whether small or great, in the
            most suitable place, and yet it shall disappear from it. But if you could hide the world
            in the world, so that there was nowhere to which it could be removed, this would be the
            grand reality of the ever-during Thing. When the body of man comes from its special
            mould, there is even then occasion for joy; but this body undergoes a myriad
            transformations, and does not immediately reach its perfection; <rhetorical>does it not
                thus afford occasion for joys incalculable?</rhetorical> Therefore the sagely man
            enjoys himself in that from which there is no possibility of separation, and by which
            all things are preserved. He considers early death or old age, his beginning and his
            ending, all to be good, and in this other men imitate him; how much more will they do so
            in regard to That Itself on which all things depend, and from which every transformation
            arises!</p>

        <p>This is the Dao; <paradox>there is in It emotion and sincerity, but It does nothing and has no

            scholars). It may be apprehended (by the mind), but It cannot be seen. It has Its root

        <p>Nan-bo Zi-kui asked Nu Yu, saying, <speech speaker="Nan-bo Zi-kui">'You are old, Sir,
                while your complexion is like that of a child; how is it so?'</speech> The reply
            was, <speech speaker="Nu Yu">'I have become acquainted with the Dao.'</speech> The other

                the man to do so. There was Bu-liang Yi who had the abilities of a sagely man, but
                not the Dao, while I had the Dao, but not the abilities. I wished, however, to teach
                him, if, peradventure, he might become the sagely man indeed. If he should not do
                so, it was easy (I thought) for one possessing the Dao of the sagely man to
                communicate it to another possessing his abilities. Accordingly, I proceeded to do
                so, but with deliberation. After three days, he was able to banish from his mind all
                worldly (matters). This accomplished, I continued my intercourse with him in the
                same way; and in seven days he was able to banish from his mind all thought of men
                and things. This accomplished, and my instructions continued, after nine days, he
                was able to count his life as foreign to himself. This accomplished, his mind was
                afterwards clear as the morning; and after this he was able to see his own
                individuality. That individuality perceived, he was able to banish all thought of
                Past or Present. Freed from this, he was able to penetrate to (the truth that there
                is no difference between) life and death - (how) the destruction of life is not
                dying, and the communication of other life is not living. (The Dao) is a thing which
                accompanies all other things and meets them, which is present when they are
                overthrown and when they obtain their completion. Its name is Tranquillity amid all

                    one body?</rhetorical> I would be friends with him.'</speech> The four men
            looked at one another and laughed, but no one seized with his mind the drift of the
            questions. All, however, were friends together. Not long after Zi-yu fell ill, and Zi-si
            went to inquire for him. <speech speaker="Zi-yu">'How great,'</speech> said (the
            sufferer), <speech speaker="Zi-yu">'is the Creator! That He should have made me the
                deformed object that I am!'</speech> He was a crooked hunchback; his five viscera
            were squeezed into the upper part of his body; his chin bent over his navel; his
            shoulder was higher than his crown; on his crown was an ulcer pointing to the sky; his
            breath came and went in gasps: yet he was easy in his mind, and made no trouble of his
            condition. He limped to a well, looked at himself in it, and said, <speech
                speaker="Zi-yu">'Alas that the Creator should have made me the deformed object that
                I am!'</speech> Si said, <speech speaker="Si">'Do you dislike your
                condition?'</speech> He replied, <speech speaker="Zi-yu">'<rhetorical>No, why should
                    I dislike it?</rhetorical> If He were to transform my left arm into a cock, I
                should be watching with it the time of the night; if He were to transform my right
                arm into a cross-bow, I should then be looking for a Xiao to (bring down and) roast;
                if He were to transform my rump-bone into a wheel, and my spirit into a horse, I
                should then be mounting it, and would not change it for another steed. Moreover,
                when we have got (what we are to do), there is the time (of life) in which to do it;
                when we lose that (at death), submission (is what is required). When we rest in what
                the time requires, and manifest that submission, neither joy nor sorrow can find
                entrance (to the mind). This would be what the ancients called loosing the cord by
                which (the life) is suspended. But one hung up cannot loose himself;-- he is held
                fast by his bonds. And that creatures cannot overcome Heaven (the inevitable) is a
                long-acknowledged fact - <rhetorical>why should I hate my
                condition?</rhetorical>'</speech></p>
        <p>Before long Zi-lai fell ill, and lay gasping at the point of death, while his wife and
            children stood around him wailing. Zi-li went to ask for him, and said to them, <speech
                speaker="Zi-li">'Hush! Get out of the way! Do not disturb him as he is passing
                through his change.'</speech> Then, leaning against the door, he said (to the dying
            man), <speech speaker="Zi-li">'Great indeed is the Creator! <rhetorical>What will He now
                    make you to become? Where will He take you to? Will He make you the liver of a
                    rat, or the arm of an insect?</rhetorical></speech> Zi-lai replied, <speech
                speaker="Zi-lai">'Wherever a parent tells a son to go, east, west, south, or north,
                he simply follows the command. The Yin and Yang are more to a man than his parents
                are. If they are hastening my death, and I do not quietly submit to them, I shall be
                obstinate and rebellious. There is the great Mass (of nature);-- I find the support
                of my body in it; my life is spent in toil on it; my old age seeks ease on it; at
                death I find rest on it: what has made my life a good will make my death also a
                good. Here now is a great founder, casting his metal. If the metal were to leap up
                (in the pot), and say, "I must be made into a (sword like the) Mo-ye," the great
                founder would be sure to regard it as uncanny. So, again, when a form is being
                fashioned in the mould of the womb, if it were to say, "I must become a man; I must
                become a man," the Creator would be sure to regard it as uncanny. When we once
                understand that heaven and earth are a great melting-pot, and the Creator a great
                founder, <rhetorical>where can we have to go to that shall not be right for

            and they continued to associate together as friends. Suddenly, after a time, Zi-sang Hu
            died. Before he was buried, Confucius heard of the event, and sent Zi-gong to go and see
            if he could render any assistance. One of the survivors had composed a ditty, and the
            other was playing on his lute. Then they sang together in unison,</p>

                of men are those? They had made none of the usual preparations, and treated the body
                as a thing foreign to them. They were singing in the presence of the corpse, and
                there was no change in their countenances. I cannot describe them; what sort of men

                for those of such different ways; and when I sent you to condole with those men, I
                was acting stupidly. They, moreover, make man to be the fellow of the Creator, and
                seek their enjoyment in the formless condition of heaven and earth. They consider
                life to be an appendage attached, an excrescence annexed to them, and death to be a
                separation of the appendage and a dispersion of the contents of the excrescence.
                With these views, <rhetorical>how should they know wherein death and life are to be
                    found, or what is first and what is last?</rhetorical> They borrow different
                substances, and pretend that the common form of the body is composed of them. They
                dismiss the thought of (its inward constituents like) the liver and gall, and (its
                outward constituents), the ears and eyes. Again and again they end and they begin,
                having no knowledge of first principles. They occupy themselves ignorantly and
                vaguely with what (they say) lies outside the dust and dirt (of the world), and seek
                their enjoyment in the business of doing nothing. <rhetorical>How should they
                    confusedly address themselves to the ceremonies practised by the common people,
                    and exhibit themselves as doing so to the ears and eyes of the
                    multitude?'</rhetorical></speech></p>
        <p>Zi-gong said, <speech speaker="Zi-gong">'Yes, but why do you, Master, act according to
                the (common) ways (of the world)?'</speech> The reply was, <speech
                speaker="Confucius">'I am in this under the condemning sentence of Heaven.
                Nevertheless, I will share with you (what I have attained to).'</speech> Zi-gong
            rejoined, <speech speaker="Zi-gong">'I venture to ask the method which you
                pursue;'</speech> and Confucius said, <speech speaker="Confucius">'Fishes breed and
                grow in the water; man developes in the Dao. Growing in the water, the fishes cleave
                the pools, and their nourishment is supplied to them. Developing in the Dao, men do
                nothing, and the enjoyment of their life is secured. Hence it is said, "Fishes
                forget one another in the rivers and lakes; men forget one another in the arts of
                the Dao."'</speech> Zi-gong said, <speech speaker="Zi-gong">'I venture to ask about
                the man who stands aloof from others.'</speech> The reply was, <speech
                speaker="Confucius">'He stands aloof from other men, but he is in accord with
                Heaven! Hence it is said, "The small man of Heaven is the superior man among men;
                the superior man among men is the small man of Heaven!"'</speech>

        <p> Yan Hui asked Zhongni, saying, <speech speaker="Yan Hui">'When the mother of Meng-sun
                Cai died, in all his wailing for her he did not shed a tear; in the core of his
                heart he felt no distress; during all the mourning rites, he exhibited no sorrow.
                Without these three things, he (was considered to have) discharged his mourning
                well; is it that in the state of Lu one who has not the reality may yet get the
                reputation of having it? I think the matter very strange.'</speech> Zhongni said,
                <speech speaker="Zhongni">'That Meng-sun carried out (his views) to the utmost. He
                was advanced in knowledge; but (in this case) <paradox>it was not possible for him to appear
                to be negligent (in his ceremonial observances)', but he succeeded in being really
                so to himself</paradox>. Meng-sun does not know either what purposes life serves, or what
                death serves; he does not know which should be first sought, and which last. If he
                is to be transformed into something else, he will simply await the transformation
                which he does not yet know. This is all he does. And moreover, when one is about to
                undergo his change, <rhetorical>how does he know that it has not taken
                    place?</rhetorical> And <rhetorical>when he is not about to undergo his change,
                    how does he know that it has taken place?</rhetorical> Take the case of me and
                you: <rhetorical>are we in a dream from which we have not begun to
                    awake?</rhetorical> Moreover, Meng-sun presented in his body the appearance of
                being agitated, but in his mind he was conscious of no loss. The death was to him
                like the issuing from one's dwelling at dawn, and no (more terrible) reality. He was
                more awake than others were. When they wailed, he also wailed, having in himself the
                reason why he did so. And we all have our individuality which makes us what we are
                as compared together; <rhetorical>but how do we know that we determine in any case
                    correctly that individuality?</rhetorical> Moreover you dream that you are a
                bird, and seem to be soaring to the sky; or that you are a fish, and seem to be
                diving in the deep. But you do not know whether we that are now speaking are awake
                or in a dream. It is not the meeting with what is pleasurable that produces the
                smile; it is not the smile suddenly produced that produces the arrangement (of the
                person). When one rests in what has been arranged, and puts away all thought of the
                transformation, he is in unity with the mysterious Heaven.'</speech></p>
