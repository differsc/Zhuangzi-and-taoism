        <p>Yan Hui went to see Zhongni, and asked leave to take his departure.<speech
                speaker="Zhongni">'Where are you going to?'</speech> asked the Master. <speech
                speaker="Yanhui">'I will go to <ref kind="historical">Wei</ref>'</speech> was the
            reply. <speech speaker="Zhongni">'And with what object?'</speech>
            <speech speaker="Yanhui">'I have heard that <ref kind="geographic">the ruler of
                    Wei</ref> is in the vigour of his years, and consults none but himself as to his
                course. <figurative style="hyperbole"><negative>He deals with his state as if it
                        were a light matter, and has no perception of his errors. He thinks lightly
                        of his people's dying; the dead are lying all over the country as if no
                        smaller space could contain them; on the plains and about the marshes, they
                        are as thick as heaps of fuel.</negative></figurative> The people know not
                where to turn to. I have heard you, Master, say, <ref kind="direct-quote">"Leave the
                    state that is well governed; go to the state where disorder prevails."</ref> At
                the door of a physician there are many who are ill. I wish through what I have heard
                (from you) to think out some methods (of dealing with <ref kind="geographic"
                    >Wei</ref>), if peradventure the evils of the state may be cured.'</speech></p>
        <p>Zhongni said, <speech speaker="Zhongni">'Alas! The risk is that you will go only to
                suffer in the punishment (of yourself)! The right method (in such a case) will not
                admit of any admixture. With such admixture, the one method will become many
                methods. Their multiplication will embarrass you. That embarrassment will make you
                anxious. However anxious you may be, you will not save (yourself). The perfect men
                of old first had (what they wanted to do) in themselves, and afterwards they found
                (the response to it) in others. <rhetorical>If what they wanted in themselves was
                    not fixed, what leisure had they to go and interfere with the proceedings of any
                    tyrannous man? Moreover, do you know how virtue is liable to be dissipated, and
                    how wisdom proceeds to display itself?</rhetorical><positive>Virtue is
                    dissipated in (the pursuit of) the name for it, and wisdom seeks to display
                    itself in the striving with others.</positive><negative>In the pursuit of the
                    name men overthrow one another; wisdom becomes a weapon of contention. Both
                    these things are instruments of evil, and should not be allowed to have free
                    course in one's conduct.</negative> Supposing one's virtue to be great and his
                sincerity firm, if he do not comprehend the spirit of those (whom he wishes to
                influence); and <negative>supposing he is free from the disposition to strive for
                    reputation, if he do not comprehend their minds;-- when in such a case he
                    forcibly insists on benevolence and righteousness, setting them forth in the
                    strongest and most direct language, before the tyrant, then he, hating (his
                    reprover's) possession of those excellences, will put him down as doing him
                    injury.</negative>
                <paradox>He who injures others is sure to be injured by them in return. You indeed
                    will hardly escape being injured by the man (to whom you go)!</paradox>
                <rhetorical>Further, if perchance he takes pleasure in men of worth and hates those
                    of an opposite character, what is the use of your seeking to make yourself out
                    to be different (from such men about him)?</rhetorical> Before you have begun to
                announce (your views), he, as king and ruler, will take advantage of you, and
                immediately contend with you for victory. Your eyes will be dazed and full of
                perplexity; you will try to look pleased with him; you will frame your words with
                care; your demeanour will be conformed to his; you will confirm him in his
                    views.<figurative style="simile">In this way you will be adding fire to fire,
                    and water to water, increasing, as we may express it, the evils (which you
                    deplore).</figurative> To these signs of deferring to him at the first there
                will be no end. You will be in danger, seeing he does not believe you, of making
                your words more strong, and you are sure to die at the hands of such a tyrant. And
                formerly <ref kind="historical">Jie killed Guan Long-feng</ref>, and <ref
                    kind="historical">Zhou killed the prince Bi-gan.</ref>
                <negative>Both of these cultivated their persons, bending down in sympathy with the
                    lower people to comfort them suffering (as they did) from their oppressors, and
                    on their account opposing their superiors.</negative> On this account, because
                they so ordered their conduct, their rulers compassed their destruction - such
                regard had they for their own fame. (Again),<ref kind="historical">Yao anciently
                    attacked (the states of) Cong-qi and Xu-ao</ref>, and <ref kind="historical">Yu
                    attacked the ruler of Hu.</ref>
                <negative>Those states were left empty, and with no one to continue their
                    population, the people being exterminated. They had engaged in war without
                    ceasing; their craving for whatever they could get was insatiable. And this
                    (ruler of Wei) is, like them, one who craves after fame and greater substance -
                    have you not heard it? Those sages were not able to overcome the thirst for fame
                    and substance - how much less will you be able to do so!</negative> Nevertheless
                you must have some ground (for the course which you wish to take); pray try and tell
                it to me.'</speech></p>
        <p>Yan Hui said, <speech speaker="Yanhui">'May I go, doing so in uprightness and humility,
                using also every endeavour to be uniform (in my plans of operation)?'</speech>
            <speech speaker="Zhongni">'No, indeed!' was the reply. '<negative>How can you do so?
                    This man makes a display of being filled to overflowing (with virtue), and has
                    great self-conceit. His feelings are not to be determined from his countenance.
                    Ordinary men do not (venture to) oppose him, and he proceeds from the way in
                    which he affects them to seek still more the satisfaction of his own mind. He
                    may be described as unaffected by the (small lessons of) virtue brought to bear
                    on him from day to day; and how much less will he be so by your great lessons?
                    He will be obstinate, and refuse to be converted. He may outwardly agree with
                    you, but inwardly there will be no self-condemnation - how can you (go to him in
                    this way and be successful)?'</negative></speech> (Yan Hui) rejoined, <speech
                speaker="Yanhui">'Well then; <positive>while inwardly maintaining my straightforward
                    intention, I will outwardly seem to bend to him. I will deliver (my lessons),
                    and substantiate them by appealing to antiquity. Inwardly maintaining my
                    straightforward intention, I shall be a co-worker with Heaven.</positive>
                <comparison topic="heaven">When I thus speak of being a co-worker with Heaven, it is
                    because I know that (the sovereign, whom we style) the son of Heaven, and
                    myself, are equally regarded by Heaven as Its sons. And should I then, as if my
                    words were only my own, be seeking to find whether men approved of them, or
                    disapproved of them? In this way men will pronounce me a (sincere and simple)
                    boy. This is what is called being a co-worker with Heaven. Outwardly bending (to
                    the ruler), I shall be a co-worker with other men.</comparison> To carry (the
                memorandum tablet to court), to kneel, and to bend the body reverentially - these
                are the observances of ministers. They all employ them, and should I presume not to
                do so? Doing what other men do, they would have no occasion to blame me. This is
                what is called being a fellow-worker with other men. Fully declaring my sentiments
                and substantiating them by appealing to antiquity, I shall be a co-worker with the
                ancients. Although the words in which I convey my lessons may really be condemnatory
                (of the ruler), they will be those of antiquity, and not my own. In this way, though
                straightforward, I shall be free from blame. This is what is called being a
                co-worker with antiquity. May I go to <ref kind="geographic">Wei</ref> in this way,
                and be successful?</speech>' <speech speaker="Zhongni">'No indeed!' said Zhongni.
                'How can you do so? You have too many plans of proceeding, and have not spied out
                (the ruler's character). Though you firmly adhere to your plans, you may be held
                free from transgression, but this will be all the result. How can you (in this way)
                produce the transformation (which you desire)? All this only shows (in you) the mind
                of a teacher!'</speech></p>

        <p>Yan Hui said, <speech speaker="Yanhui">'I can go no farther; I venture to ask the method
                from you.'</speech> Zhongni replied, <speech speaker="Zhongni">'It is fasting, (as)
                I will tell you. (But) when you have the method, will you find it easy to practise
                it? He who thinks it easy will be disapproved of by the bright Heaven.'</speech> Hui
            said, <speech speaker="Yanhui">'My family is poor. For months together we have no
                spirituous drink, nor do we taste the proscribed food or any strong-smelling
                vegetables;-- can this be regarded as fasting?'</speech> The reply was, <speech
                speaker="Zhongni">'It is the fasting appropriate to sacrificing, but it is not the
                fasting of the mind.'</speech>
            <speech speaker="Yanhui">'I venture to ask what that fasting of the mind is,'</speech>
            said Hui, and Zhongni answered, <speech speaker="Zhongni">'<paradox
                    topic="mind and body">Maintain a perfect unity in every movement of your will,
                    You will not wait for the hearing of your ears about it, but for the hearing of
                    your mind. You will not wait even for the hearing of your mind, but for the
                    hearing of the spirit. Let the hearing (of the ears) rest with the ears. Let the
                    mind rest in the verification (of the rightness of what is in the will). But the
                    spirit is free from all pre-occupation and so waits for (the appearance of)
                    things. Where the (proper) course is, there is freedom from all pre-occupation;
                    such freedom is the fasting of the mind.'</paradox></speech> Hui said, <speech
                speaker="Ynahui">'Before it was possible for me to employ (this method), there I
                was, the Hui that I am; now, that I can employ it, the Hui that I was has passed
                away. Can I be said to have obtained this freedom from pre-occupation?'</speech></p>
        <p>The Master replied, <speech speaker="Zhongni">'Entirely. I tell you that you can enter
                and be at ease in the enclosure (where he is), and not come into collision with the
                reputation (which belongs to him). If he listen to your counsels, let him hear your
                notes; if he will not listen, be silent. <figurative style="metaphor">Open no
                    (other) door; employ no other medicine; dwell with him (as with a friend) in the
                    same apartment, and as if you had no other option, and you will not be far from
                    success in your object.</figurative>
                <comparison topic="mind and body">not to move a step is easy; to walk without
                    treading on the ground is difficult. In acting after the manner of men, it is
                    easy to fall into hypocrisy; in acting after the manner of Heaven, it is
                    difficult to play the hypocrite. I have heard of flying with wings; I have not
                    heard of flying without them. I have heard of the knowledge of the wise; I have
                    not heard of the knowledge of the unwise.</comparison> Look at that aperture
                (left in the wall); the empty apartment is filled with light through it. Felicitous
                influences rest (in the mind thus emblemed), as in their proper resting place. Even
                when they do not so rest, we have what is called (the body) seated and (the mind)
                galloping abroad. The information that comes through the ears and eyes is
                comprehended internally, and the knowledge of the mind becomes something external:
                (when this is the case), the spiritual intelligences will come, and take up their
                dwelling with us, and how much more will other men do so! All things thus undergo a
                transforming influence. This was the hinge on which Yu and Shun moved; it was this
                which Fu-xi and Ji-qu practised all their lives: how much more should other men
                follow the same rule!'</speech></p>

        <p>Zi Gao, duke of <ref kind="historical">She</ref>, being about to proceed on a mission to
            Qi, asked Zhongni, saying, <speech speaker="Zigao">'The king is sending me, <ref
                    kind="historical">Zhu Liang</ref>, on a mission which is very important. Qi will
                probably treat me as his commissioner with great respect, but it will not be in a
                hurry (to attend to the business). Even an ordinary man cannot be readily moved (to
                action), and how much less the prince of a state! I am very full of apprehension.
                You, <comparison topic="right and wrong">Sir, once said to me that of all things,
                    great or small, there were few which, if not conducted in the proper way, could
                    be brought to a happy conclusion; that, if the thing were not successful, there
                    was sure to be the evil of being dealt with after the manner of men; that, if it
                    were successful, there was sure to be the evil of constant anxiety; and that,
                    whether it succeeded or not, it was only the virtuous man who could secure its
                    not being followed by evil.</comparison> In my diet I take what is coarse, and
                do not seek delicacies - a man whose cookery does not require him to be using
                cooling drinks. This morning I received my charge, and in the evening I am drinking
                iced water; am I not feeling the internal heat (and discomfort)? Such is my state
                before I have actually engaged in the affair; I am already suffering from
                conflicting anxieties. And if the thing do not succeed, (the king) is sure to deal
                with me after the manner of men. The evil is twofold; as a minister, I am not able
                to bear the burden (of the mission). Can you, Sir, tell me something (to help me in
                the case)?'</speech></p>
        <p>Zhongni replied, <speech speaker="Zhongni">'In all things under heaven there are two
                great cautionary considerations: the one is the requirement implanted (in the
                nature); the other is the conviction of what is right. The love of a son for his
                parents is the implanted requirement, and can never be separated from his heart; the
                service of his ruler by a minister is what is right, and from its obligation there
                is no escaping anywhere between heaven and earth. These are what are called the
                great cautionary considerations. Therefore a son finds his rest in serving his
                parents without reference to or choice of place; and this is the height of filial
                duty. In the same way a subject finds his rest in serving his ruler, without
                reference to or choice of the business; and this is the fullest discharge of
                loyalty. When men are simply obeying (the dictates of) their hearts, the
                considerations of grief and joy are not readily set before them. They know that
                there is no alternative to their acting as they do, and rest in it as what is
                appointed; and this is the highest achievement of virtue. He who is in the position
                of a minister or of a son has indeed to do what he cannot but do. Occupied with the
                details of the business (in hand), and forgetful of his own person, what leisure has
                he to think of his pleasure in living or his dislike of death? You, my master, may
                well proceed on your mission. But let me repeat to you what I have heard: In all
                intercourse (between states), if they are near to each other, there should be mutual
                friendliness, verified by deeds; if they are far apart, there must be sincere
                adherence to truth in their messages. Those messages will be transmitted by
                internuncios. But to convey messages which express the complacence or the
                dissatisfaction of the two parties is the most difficult thing in the world. If they
                be those of mutual complacence, there is sure to be an overflow of expressions of
                satisfaction; if of mutual dissatisfaction, an overflow of expressions of dislike.
                But all extravagance leads to reckless language, and such language fails to command
                belief. When this distrust arises, woe to the internuncio! Hence the Rules for
                Speech say, <ref kind="direct-quote">"Transmit the message exactly as it stands; do
                    not transmit it with any overflow of language; so is (the internuncio) likely to
                    keep himself whole."</ref>
                <comparison>Moreover, skilful wrestlers begin with open trials of strength, but
                    always end with masked attempts (to gain the victory);</comparison> as their
                excitement grows excessive, they display much wonderful dexterity. Parties drinking
                according to the rules at first observe good order, but always end with disorder; as
                their excitement grows excessive, their fun becomes uproarious. In all things it is
                so. People are at first sincere, but always end with becoming rude; at the
                commencement things are treated as trivial, but as the end draws near, they assume
                great proportions. Words are (like) the waves acted on by the wind; <figurative
                    style="simile">the real point of the matters (discussed by them) is lost. The
                    wind and waves are easily set in motion; the success of the matter of which the
                    real point is lost is easily put in peril. Hence quarrels are occasioned by
                    nothing so much as by artful words and one-sided speeches.</figurative> The
                breath comes angrily, as when a beast, driven to death, wildly bellows forth its
                rage. On this animosities arise on both sides. Hasty examination (of the case)
                eagerly proceeds, and revengeful thoughts arise in their minds; they do not know
                how. Since they do not know how such thoughts arise, who knows how they will end?
                Hence the Rules for Speech say, <ref kind="indirect-quote">"Let not an internuncius
                    depart from his instructions. Let him not urge on a settlement. If he go beyond
                    the regular rules, he will complicate matters. Departing from his instructions

                there are dangers connected with both of these things. While seeking to keep near to
                him, do not enter into his pursuits; while cultivating a harmony of mind with him,
                do not show how superior you are to him. If in your personal association you enter
                into his pursuits, you will fall with him and be ruined, you will tumble down with a
                crash. If in maintaining a harmony with his mind, you show how different you are

                how much it thinks of its own powers. Be on your guard; be careful. If you cherish a
                boastful confidence in your own excellence, and place yourself in collision with
                him, you are likely to incur the fate (of the mantis). <figurative style="simile">Do

        <p>A (master) mechanic, called Shi, on his way to <ref kind="geographic">Qi</ref>, came to
                <ref kind="geographic">Qu-yuan</ref>, where he saw an oak-tree, which was used as
            the altar for the spirits of the land. It was so large that an ox standing behind it
            could not be seen. It measured a hundred spans round, and rose up eighty cubits on the
            hill before it threw out any branches, after which there were ten or so, from each of
            which a boat could be hollowed out. People came to see it in crowds as in a market
            place, but the mechanic did not look round at it, but held on his way without stopping.
            One of his workmen, however, looked long and admiringly at it, and then ran on to his
            master, and said to him, <speech speaker="workman">'Since I followed you with my axe and
                bill, I have never seen such a beautiful mass of timber as this. Why would you, Sir,
                not look round at it, but went on without stopping?'</speech>
            <speech speaker="Mr.shi">'Have done,' said Mr. Shi, 'and do not speak about it. It is
                quite useless. <negative>A boat made from its wood would sink; a coffin or shell
                    would quickly rot; an article of furniture would soon go to pieces; a door would
                    be covered with the exuding sap; a pillar would be riddled by insects; the
                    material of it is good for nothing, and hence it is that it has attained to so
                    great an age.'</negative></speech></p>
        <p>When Mr. Shi was returning, the altar-oak appeared to him in a dream, and said, <speech
                speaker="altar-oak">'What other tree will you compare with me? Will you compare me
                to one of your ornamental trees? <negative>There are hawthorns, pear-trees,
                    orange-trees, pummelo-trees, gourds and other low fruit-bearing plants. When
                    their fruits are ripe, they are knocked down from them, and thrown among the
                    dirt. The large branches are broken, and the smaller are torn away.</negative>
                <comparison>So it is that their productive ability makes their lives bitter to them;
                    they do not complete their natural term of existence, but come to a premature
                    end in the middle of their time, bringing on themselves the destructive
                    treatment which they ordinarily receive. It is so with all things. I have sought
                    to discover how it was that I was so useless; I had long done so, till (the
                    effort) nearly caused my death; and now I have learned it - it has been of the
                    greatest use to me.</comparison><rhetorical>Suppose that I had possessed useful
                    properties, should I have become of the great size that I am? And moreover you
                    and I are both things - how should one thing thus pass its judgment on another?
                    how is it that you a useless man know all this about me a useless
                    tree?'</rhetorical></speech> When Mr. Shih awoke, he kept thinking about his
            dream, but the workman said, <speech speaker="workman">'Being so taken with its
                uselessness, how is it that it yet acts here as the altar for the spirits of the
                land?'</speech><speech speaker="Mr.shi"> 'Be still,' was the master's reply, 'and do
                not say a word. It simply happened to grow here; and thus those who do not know it
                do not speak ill of it as an evil thing. If it were not used as the altar, would it
                be in danger of being cut down? Moreover, the reason of its being preserved is
                different from that of the preservation of things generally; is not your explaining
                it from the sentiment which you have expressed wide of the mark?'</speech></p>

                could be made from them. He licked one of its leaves, and his mouth felt torn and

            there is <ref kind="geographic">the district of Jing-shi</ref>, in which catalpae,
            cypresses, and mulberry trees grow well. Those of them which are a span or two or rather
            more in circumference are cut down by persons who want to make posts to which to tie
            their monkeys; those which are three or four spans round are cut down by persons who
            want beams forr their lofty and famous houses; and those of seven or eight spans are cut
            down by noblemen and rich merchants who want single planks for the sides of their
            coffins. The trees in consequence do not complete their natural term of life, and come
            to a premature end in the middle of their growth under the axe and bill;-- this is the
            evil that befalls them from their supplying good timber. In the same way the Jie (book)
            specifies oxen that have white foreheads, pigs that have turned-up snouts, and men that
