        <p>Nie Que put four questions to Wang Ni, not one of which did he know (how to answer). On
            this Nie Que leaped up, and in great delight walked away and informed Yu-yi Zi of it,
            who said to him, <speech speaker="Yuyizi">'Do you (only) now know it?' He of the line of
                    <ref kind="historical">Yu</ref> was not equal to him of the line of <ref
                    kind="historical">Tai</ref>. He of Yu still kept in himself (the idea of)
                benevolence by which to constrain (the submission of) men; and he did win men, but
                he had not begun to proceed by what did not belong to him as a man. He of the line
                of Tai would sleep tranquilly, and awake in contented simplicity. He would consider
                himself now (merely) as a horse, and now (merely) as an ox. His knowledge was real
                and untroubled by doubts; and his virtue was very true: he had not begun to proceed
                by what belonged to him as a man.'</speech></p>

        <p>Jian Wu went to see the mad (recluse), Jie-yu, who said to him, <speech speaker="Jieyu"
                >'What did <ref kind="historical">Ri-Zhong Shi</ref> tell you?'</speech> The reply
            was, <speech speaker="Jianwu">'He told me that when rulers gave forth their regulations
                according to their own views and enacted righteous measures, no one would venture
                not to obey them, and all would be transformed.'</speech> Jie-yu said, <speech
                speaker="Jieyu">'That is but the hypocrisy of virtue. For the right ordering of the
                world it would be like trying to wade through the sea and dig through the He, or
                employing a mosquito to carry a mountain on its back. And when a sage is governing,
                does he govern men's outward actions? He is (himself) correct, and so (his
                government) goes on; this is the simple and certain way by which he secures the
                success of his affairs. <figurative style="metaphor">Think of the bird which flies
                    high, to avoid being hurt by the dart on the string of the archer, and the
                    little mouse which makes its hole deep under Shen-qiu to avoid the danger of
                    being smoked or dug out; are (rulers) less knowing than these two little
                    creatures?'</figurative></speech></p>

        <p>Tian Gen, rambling on the south of <ref kind="geographic">(mount) Yin</ref>, came to the
            neighbourhood of the <ref kind="geographic">Liao-water</ref>. Happening there to meet
            with the man whose name is not known, he put a question to him, saying, <speech
                speaker="Tiangen">'I beg to ask what should be done in order to (carry on) the
                government of the world.'</speech> The nameless man said, <speech
                speaker="The nameless man">'Go away; you are a rude borderer. Why do you put to me a
                question for which you are unprepared? I would simply play the part of the Maker of
                (all) things. When wearied, I would mount on the bird of the light and empty air,
                proceed beyond the six cardinal points, and wander in the region of nonentity, to
                dwell in the wilderness of desert space. What method have you, moreover, for the
                government of the world that you (thus) agitate my mind?'</speech> (Tian Gen),
            however, again asked the question, and the nameless man said, <speech speaker="Tiangen"
                >'Let your mind find its enjoyment in pure simplicity; blend yourself with (the
                primary) ether in idle indifference; allow all things to take their natural course;
                and admit no personal or selfish consideration - do this and the world will be
                governed.'</speech></p>

        <p>Yang Zi-ju, having an interview with Lao Dan, said to him, <speech speaker="Yangziju"

                    clearsighted and widely intelligent, and an unwearied student of the Dao - can
                    he be compared to one of the intelligent kings?'</positive></speech> The reply
            was, <speech speaker="Laodan">'<negative>Such a man is to one of the intelligent kings
                    but as the bustling underling of a court who toils his body and distresses his
                    mind with his various contrivances. And moreover, it is the beauty of the skins
                    of the tiger and leopard which makes men hunt them; the agility of the monkey,
                    or (the sagacity of) the dog that catches the yak, which make men lead them in
                    strings; but can one similarly endowed be compared to the intelligent
                    kings?'</negative></speech> Yang Zi-ju looked discomposed and said, <speech
                speaker="Yangziju">'I venture to ask you what the government of the intelligent
                kings is.'</speech> Lao Dan replied, <speech speaker="Laodan">'<positive>In the
                    governing of the intelligent kings, their services overspread all under the sky,
                    but they did not seem to consider it as proceeding from themselves; their
                    transforming influence reached to all things, but the people did not refer it to
                    them with hope. No one could tell the name of their agency, but they made men
                    and things be joyful in themselves. Where they took their stand could not be
                    fathomed, and they found their enjoyment in (the realm of)
                    nonentity.'</positive></speech></p>

        <p>In Zheng there was a mysterious wizard called Ji-xian. He knew all about the deaths and
            births of men, their preservation and ruin, their misery and happiness, and whether
            their lives would be long or short, foretelling the year, the month, the decade and the
            day like a spirit. When the people of Kang saw him, they all ran out of his way. Liezi
            went to see him, and was fascinated by him. Returning, he told Hu-zi of his interview,
            and said, <speech speaker="Liezi">'I considered your doctrine, my master, to be perfect,
                but I have found another which is superior to it.'</speech> Hu-zi replied, <speech
                speaker="Huzi">'I have communicated to you but the outward letter of my doctrine,
                and have not communicated its reality and spirit; and do you think that you are in
                possession of it? However many hens there be, if there be not the cock among them,
                how should they lay (real) eggs? When you confront the world with your doctrine, you
                are sure to show in your countenance (all that is in your mind), and so enable
                (this) man to succeed in interpreting your physiognomy. Try and come to me with him,
                that I may show myself to him.'</speech> On the morrow, accordingly, Liezi came with
            the man and saw Hu-zi. When they went out, the wizard said, <speech speaker="the wizard"
                >'Alas! your master is a dead man. He will not live;-- not for ten days more! I saw
                something strange about him - I saw the ashes (of his life) all slaked with
                water!'</speech> When Liezi reentered, he wept till the front of his jacket was wet
            with his tears, and told Hu-zi what the man had said.</p>
        <p>Hu-zi said, <speech speaker="Huzi">'I showed myself to him with the forms of (vegetation
                beneath) the earth. There were the sprouts indeed, but without (any appearance of)
                growth or regularity:-- he seemed to see me with the springs of my (vital) power
                closed up. Try and come to me with him again.'</speech> Next day, accordingly, Liezi
            brought the man again and saw Hu-zi. When they went out, the man said, <speech
                speaker="the wizard">'It is a fortunate thing for your master that he met with me.
                He will get better; he has all the signs of living! I saw the balance (of the
                springs of life) that had been stopped (inclining in his favour).'</speech> Liezi
            went in, and reported these words to his master, who said, <speech speaker="Huzi">'I
                showed myself to him after the pattern of the earth (beneath the) sky. Neither
                semblance nor reality entered (into my exhibition), but the springs (of life) were
                issuing from beneath my feet;-- he seemed to see me with the springs of vigorous
                action in full play. Try and come with him again.'</speech> Next day Liezi came with
            the man again, and again saw Hu-zi with him. When they went out, the wizard said,
                <speech speaker="the wizard">'Your master is never the same. I cannot understand his
                physiognomy. Let him try to steady himself, and I will again view him.'</speech>
            Liezi went in and reported this to Hu-zi, who said, <speech speaker="Huzi">'This time I
                showed myself to him after the pattern of the grand harmony (of the two elemental
                forces), with the superiority inclining to neither. He seemed to see me with the
                springs of (vital) power in equal balance. Where the water wheels about from (the
                movements of) a dugong, there is an abyss; where it does so from the arresting (of
                its course), there is an abyss; where it does so, and the water keeps flowing on,
                there is an abyss. There are nine abysses with their several names, and I have only
                exhibited three of them. Try and come with him again.'</speech> Next day they came,
            and they again saw Hu-zi. But before he had settled himself in his position, the wizard
            lost himself and ran away. <speech speaker="Huzi">'Pursue him,'</speech> said Hu-zi, and
            Liezi did so, but could not come up with him. He returned, and told Hu-zi, saying,
                <speech speaker="Liezi">'There is an end of him; he is lost; I could not find
                him.'</speech></p>
        <p>Hu-zi rejoined, <speech speaker="Huzi">'I was showing him myself after the pattern of
                what was before I began to come from my author. I confronted him with pure vacancy,
                and an easy indifference. He did not know what I meant to represent. Now he thought
                it was the idea of exhausted strength, and now that of an onward flow, and therefore
                he ran away.'</speech> After this, Liezi considered that he had not yet begun to
            learn (his master's doctrine). He returned to his house, and for three years did not go
            out. He did the cooking for his wife. He fed the pigs as if he were feeding men. He took
            no part or interest in occurring affairs. He put away the carving and sculpture about
            him, and returned to pure simplicity. Like a clod of earth he stood there in his bodily
            presence. Amid all distractions he was (silent) and shut up in himself. And in this way
            he continued to the end of his life.</p>

        <p><comparison topic="non-action">Non-action (makes its exemplifier) the lord of all fame;
                non-action (serves him as) the treasury of all plans; non-action (fits him for) the
                burden of all offices; non-action (makes him) the lord of all wisdom. The range of
                his action is inexhaustible, but there is nowhere any trace of his presence. He
                fulfils all that he has received from Heaven, but he does not see that he was the
                recipient of anything. A pure vacancy (of all purpose) is what characterises him.
                When the perfect man employs his mind, it is a mirror.</comparison> It conducts
            nothing and anticipates nothing; it responds to (what is before it), but does not retain
            it. Thus he is able to deal successfully with all things, and injures none.</p>

        <p>The Ruler of the Southern Ocean was Shu, the Ruler of the Northern Ocean was Hu, and the
            Ruler of the Centre was Chaos. Shu and Hu were continually meeting in the land of Chaos,
            who treated them very well. They consulted together how they might repay his kindness,
            and said, <speech speaker="Shu and Hu">'Men all have seven orifices for the purpose of
                seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing, while this (poor) Ruler alone has not one.
                Let us try and make them for him.' Accordingly they dug one orifice in him every
                day; and at the end of seven days Chaos died.</speech></p>
