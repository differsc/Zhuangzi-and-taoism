    <section><parable>In the <ext-ref type="Body of Water">Northern Ocean</ext-ref> there is a fish,
            the name of which is Kun - I do not know how many li in size. It changes into a bird
            with the name of Peng, the back of which is (also) - I do not know how many li in
            extent. When this bird rouses itself and flies, its wings are like clouds all round the
            sky. When the sea is moved (so as to bear it along), it prepares to remove to the
                <ext-ref type="Body of Water">Southern Ocean</ext-ref>. The <ext-ref
                type="Body of Water">Southern Ocean</ext-ref> is the Pool of Heaven. There is the
            (book called) <ext-ref type="Book">Qi Xie</ext-ref>, a record of marvels. We have in it
            these words: 'When the peng is removing to the Southern Ocean it flaps (its wings) on
            the water for 3000 li. Then it ascends on a whirlwind 90,000 li, and it rests only at
            the end of six months.' (But similar to this is the movement of the breezes which we
            call) the horses of the fields, of the dust (which quivers in the sunbeams), and of
            living things as they are blown against one another by the air. <question>Is its azure
                the proper colour of the sky?</question>
            <question>Or is it occasioned by its distance and illimitable extent?</question> If one
            were looking down (from above), the very same appearance would just meet his view. And
            moreover, (to speak of) the accumulation of water; if it be not great, it will not have
            strength to support a large boat. Upset a cup of water in a cavity, and a straw will
            float on it as if it were a boat. Place a cup in it, and it will stick fast; the water
            is shallow and the boat is large. (So it is with) the accumulation of wind; if it be not
            great, it will not have strength to support great wings. Therefore (the peng ascended
            to) the height of 90,000 li, and there was such a mass of wind beneath it; thenceforth
            the accumulation of wind was sufficient. As it seemed to bear the blue sky on its back,
            and there was nothing to obstruct or arrest its course, it could pursue its way to the
            South. A cicada and a little dove laughed at it, saying, 'We make an effort and fly
            towards an elm or sapanwood tree; and sometimes before we reach it, we can do no more
            but drop to the ground. <question>Of what use is it for this (creature) to rise 90,000
                li, and make for the South?'</question></parable><parable> He who goes to the grassy
            suburbs, returning to the third meal (of the day), will have his belly as full as when
            he set out; he who goes to a distance of 100 li will have to pound his grain where he
            stops for the night; he who goes a thousand li, will have to carry with him provisions
            for three months.</parable>
        <question>What should these two small creatures know about the matter?</question> The
        knowledge of that which is small does not reach to that which is great; (the experience of)
        a few years does not reach to that of many. <question>How do we know that it is
            so?</question> The mushroom of a morning does not know (what takes place between) the
        beginning and end of a month; the short-lived cicada does not know (what takes place
        between) the spring and autumn. These are instances of a short term of life. In the south of
        Chu there is the (tree) called Ming-ling, whose spring is 500 years, and its autumn the
        same; in high antiquity there was that called Da-chun, whose spring was 8000 years, and its
        autumn the same. And <person name="Peng Zu">Peng Zu</person> is the one man renowned to the
        present day for his length of life: <question>if all men were (to wish) to match him, would
            they not be miserable?</question></section>
    <section><ext-ref type="Conversation">In the questions put by <person name="Tang">Tang</person>
            to <person name="Ji">Ji</person> we have similar statements</ext-ref>: <parable>'In the
            bare and barren north there is the dark and vast ocean - the Pool of Heaven. In it there
            is a fish, several thousand li in breadth, while no one knows its length. Its name is
            the kun. There is (also) a bird named the peng; its back is like the Tai mountain, while
            its wings are like clouds all round the sky. On a whirlwind it mounts upwards as on the
            whorls of a goat's horn for 90,000 li, till, far removed from the cloudy vapours, it
            bears on its back the blue sky, and then it shapes its course for the South, and
            proceeds to the ocean there.' A quail by the side of a marsh laughed at it, and said,
                '<question>Where is it going to?</question> I spring up with a bound, and come down
            again when I have reached but a few fathoms, and then fly about among the brushwood and
            bushes; and this is the perfection of flying. <question>Where is that creature going
                to?'</question></parable> This shows the difference between the small and the
        great.</section>
    <section>Thus it is that men, whose wisdom is sufficient for the duties of some one office, or
        whose conduct will secure harmony in some one district, or whose virtue is befitting a ruler
        so that they could efficiently govern some one state, are sure to look on themselves in this
        manner (like the quail), and yet <person name="Rongzi">Rongzi of <ext-ref type="Place"
                >Song</ext-ref></person> would have smiled and laughed at them. (This <person
            name="Rongzi">Rongzi</person>), though the whole world should have praised him, would
        not for that have stimulated himself to greater endeavour, and though the whole world should
        have condemned him, would not have exercised any more repression of his course; so fixed was
        he in the difference between the internal (judgment of himself) and the external (judgment
        of others), so distinctly had he marked out the bounding limit of glory and disgrace. Here,
        however, he stopped. His place in the world indeed had become indifferent to him, but still
        he had not planted himself firmly (in the right position). There was <person name="Leizi"
            >Liezi</person>, who rode on the wind and pursued his way, with an admirable
        indifference (to all external things), returning, however, after fifteen days, (to his
        place). In regard to the things that (are supposed to) contribute to happiness, he was free
        from all endeavours to obtain them; but though he had not to walk, there was still something
        for which he had to wait. <question>But suppose one who mounts on (the ether of) heaven and
            earth in its normal operation, and drives along the six elemental energies of the
            changing (seasons), thus enjoying himself in the illimitable - what has he to wait
            for?</question> Therefore it is said, <sagely>'The Perfect man has no (thought of) self;
            the Spirit-like man, none of merit; the Sagely-minded man, none of fame.'</sagely>

        <person name="Jian Wu">Jian Wu</person> asked <person name="Lian Shu">Lian Shu</person>,
        saying, 'I heard <person name="Jie Yu">Jie Yu</person> talking words which were great, but
        had nothing corresponding to them (in reality); once gone, they could not be brought back. I
        was frightened by them; they were like the Milky Way which cannot be traced to its beginning
        or end. They had no connexion with one another, and were not akin to the experiences of
        men.' 'What were his words?' asked <person name="Lian Shu">Lian Shu</person>, and the other
        replied, (He said) that <parable>'Far away on the hill of Gu Ye there dwelt a Spirit-like
            man whose flesh and skin were (smooth) as ice and (white) as snow; that his manner was
            elegant and delicate as that of a virgin; that he did not eat any of the five grains,
            but inhaled the wind and drank the dew; that he mounted on the clouds, drove along the
            flying dragons, rambling and enjoying himself beyond the four seas; that by the
            concentration of his spirit-like powers he could save men from disease and pestilence,
            and secure every year a plentiful harvest.'</parable> These words appeared to me wild
        and incoherent and I did not believe them. 'So it is,' said <person name="Lian Shu">Lian
            Shu</person>. 'The blind have no perception of the beauty of elegant figures, nor the
        deaf of the sound of bells and drums. <question>But is it only the bodily senses of which
            deafness and blindness can be predicated?</question> There is also a similar defect in
        the intelligence; and of this your words supply an illustration in yourself. That man, with
        those attributes, though all things were one mass of confusion, and he heard in that
        condition the whole world crying out to him to be rectified, would not have to address
        himself laboriously to the task, as if it were his business to rectify the world. Nothing
        could hurt that man; the greatest floods, reaching to the sky, could not drown him, nor
        would he feel the fervour of the greatest heats melting metals and stones till they flowed,
        and scorching all the ground and hills. From the dust and chaff of himself, he could still
        mould and fashion <ext-ref type="Unsure">Yaos and Shuns</ext-ref> - how should he be willing
        to occupy himself with things?' A man of <ext-ref type="City">Song</ext-ref>, who dealt in
        the ceremonial caps (of <ext-ref type="Unsure">Yin</ext-ref>), went with them to <ext-ref
            type="City">Yue</ext-ref>, the people of which cut off their hair and tattooed their
        bodies, so that they had no use for them. Yao ruled the people of the kingdom, and
        maintained a perfect government within the four seas. Having gone to see the four (Perfect)
        Ones on the distant hill of <ext-ref type="Geographic Location">Gu Ye</ext-ref>, when (he

        <person name="Huizi">Huizi</person> told <person name="Zhuangzi">Zhuangzi</person>,
            saying,<parable>'The king of <ext-ref type="Kingdom">Wei</ext-ref> sent me some seeds of
            a large calabash, which I sowed. The fruit, when fully grown, could contain five piculs
            (of anything). I used it to contain water, but it was so heavy that I could not lift it
            by myself. I cut it in two to make the parts into drinking vessels; but the dried shells
            were too wide and unstable and would not hold (the liquor); nothing but large useless
            things! Because of their uselessness I knocked them to pieces.'</parable>
        <person name="Zhuangzi">Zhuangzi</person> replied, 'You were indeed stupid, my master, in
        the use of what was large. <parable>There was a man of <ext-ref type="City">Song</ext-ref>
            who was skilful at making a salve which kept the hands from getting chapped; and (his
            family) for generations had made the bleaching of cocoon-silk their business. A stranger
            heard of it, and proposed to buy the art of the preparation for a hundred ounces of
            silver. The kindred all came together, and considered the proposal. "We have," said
            they, "been bleaching cocoon-silk for generations, and have only gained a little money.
            Now in one morning we can sell to this man our art for a hundred ounces - let him have
            it." The stranger accordingly got it and went away with it to give counsel to the king
            of Wu, who was then engaged in hostilities with <person name="Yue">Yue</person>. The
            king gave him the command of his fleet, and in the winter he had an engagement with that
            of <person name="Yue">Yue</person>, on which he inflicted a great defeat, and was
            invested with a portion of territory taken from <person name="Yue">Yue</person>. The
            keeping the hands from getting chapped was the same in both cases; but in the one case
            it led to the investiture (of the possessor of the salve), and in the other it had only
            enabled its owners to continue their bleaching. The difference of result was owing to
            the different use made of the art.</parable> Now you, Sir, had calabashes large enough
        to hold five piculs; why did you not think of making large bottle-gourds of them, by means
        of which you could have floated over rivers and lakes, instead of giving yourself the sorrow
        of finding that they were useless for holding anything. Your mind, my master, would seem to
        have been closed against all intelligence!'</section>

            <parable>'I have a large tree, which men call the Ailantus. Its trunk swells out to a
            large size, but is not fit for a carpenter to apply his line to it; its smaller branches
            are knotted and crooked, so that the disk and square cannot be used on them. Though
            planted on the wayside, a builder would not turn his head to look at it. Now your words,

            or dies in a net. Again there is the Yak, so large that it is like a cloud hanging in
            the sky. It is large indeed, but it cannot catch mice. You, Sir, have a large tree and
            are troubled because it is of no use - why do you not plant it in a tract where there is
            nothing else, or in a wide and barren wild? There you might saunter idly by its side, or
            in the enjoyment of untroubled ease sleep beneath it. Neither bill nor axe would shorten
