# Meeting Notes 1/26

Our first meeting! 

- Generated SSH keys
- Downloaded GitBash
- Cloned repos onto local computer (Hanwen's SSH key was not working, so it was cloned from HTTPS)
- Went through git pull/add/commit/push commands (Hanwen's push not working; going to look into error message in slack)

**For next time:**
- Read through texts linked in Sam's project proposal
- Begin thinking of research ventures
- Sam on project update for this week
