**What was done over the week**
- Midterm tasks done! Markup was completed on all 7 chapters
- Hanwen commented context onto the Confucian text, as well as pointed out what the text was (as it differs from the Zhuangzi)

**Events of the meeting**
- Discussed wireframing (Sam was going to make a concrete wireframe but got sick, which is totally fine)
- Discussed what MALLET might do for the project; decided it would be cool to see what topics it pulls out
- Looked into MALLET processing

**Assignment for the break**
- Both: have a good spring break!!
- Sam: get better
