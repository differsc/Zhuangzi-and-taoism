# Meeting Notes 2023-02-16

**What was accomplished this week**
- Sam: revised XML markup of chapter 1 according to the schema and marked up chapters 3 and 5 according to the new schema
- Hanwen: Did markup of chapter 4 according to the schema

**Accomplished during meeting**
- Confucian texts? Analects: 2, 6, 12, maybe others (Hanwen) --> side by side reading view maybe
- Maybe have list of "characters"; be able to hover over character names and get a little blurb about them within the text
- In the future, compile list of links for "further reading"
- Projects tab (for Ella)

**Website ideas**
- Faded text at top with Zhuangzi quote that is different each time (Ella look into this)
- Black and white color scheme; maybe symbols as graphics (yin and yang as favicon)
- Chapter reading view tab --> linked to further reading (other chapters)
- "If interested" links
- Biography in about section
