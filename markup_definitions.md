# Definitions

**Figurative language**
- Types of language (see `style` attribute for list)

**Paradox**
- "a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true."

**Comparision**
- Zhuangzi comparing opposite things; not exactly "absurd" like a paradox would be

**Positive/Negative**
- Sometimes comparison doesn't come hand in hand, so we tag it differently

**Rhetorical**
- Asking rhetorical questions (i.e. a question with an implied answer)
